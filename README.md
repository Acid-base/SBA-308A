 Advanced Javascript Web Application


    Use Asynchronous JavaScript Tools: Make sure to incorporate asynchronous features like Promises and async/await in your application. These tools allow you to handle tasks that might take time (such as fetching data from an API) without blocking the main thread.

    Understand the JavaScript Event Loop: Familiarize yourself with how the event loop works. Itâ€™s essential for managing asynchronous operations effectively.

    Generate Asynchronous Code: Write code that utilizes Promises and async/await syntax. These constructs make it easier to work with asynchronous tasks.

    Interact with External Web APIs: Use the fetch API or Axios to retrieve data from an external web API. This could be anything from weather data to movie information.

    Organize Files Using Modules and Imports: Keep your codebase organized by using modules and imports. This helps maintain a clean structure and makes it easier to collaborate with others.
