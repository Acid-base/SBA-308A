# Project Title: JSONPlaceholder API Interaction

## Description
This project demonstrates how to interact with APIs using JavaScript. It includes functionalities for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting posts. This application is designed to help new developers understand how to work with APIs in JavaScript using Fetch API, async/await, and modular JavaScript design patterns. It doesn't have a real backend, so it's not possible to create, update, or delete posts and view changes, but the developer debugging tools can be used to see the example API requests and responses.

## Features

- Create new posts and reflect changes in the API.
- Update existing posts.
- Delete posts.
- Modular JavaScript architecture with separate modules for API handling and UI rendering.
- Error handling and user notifications.
